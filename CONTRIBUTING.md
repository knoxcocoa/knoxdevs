# Contributing

:sparkles: Thank you for considering contributing to the KnoxDevs app.

## Questions, comments, and other feedback

The [Issues] page is available for questions, comments, and other feedback
related to development of the app.

## Data

A SQLite file named `knoxdevs.db` is the database for the app. New groups,
organizers, and/or locations must be added to this file. The database file can
be easily edited with the cross-platform [DB Browser] app.

## Design

Icons and images for the app are designed with [Sketch] and are available in the
`knoxdevs.sketch` file. Assets for the KnoxDevs app are exported into Xcode from
the Sketch document.

## Style

To ensure consistent code quality, please adhere to the Ray Wenderlich Swift
[style guide].

## Code submission

Follow the [GitHub flow] guide to contribute to the KnoxDevs app. Basically,
development work is done on a branch other than `master` then submitted as a
Pull Request.
